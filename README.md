Software Interfaces
Software interfaces for a resume creator website typically involve the integration of different components and systems to ensure smooth operation and data flow. Here are some common software interfaces involved in a resume creator website:
User Interface (UI):
The user interface handles the interaction between the website and the user, allowing users to input data, customize resume templates, and navigate through the website's features. It typically uses front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Application Programming Interface (API):
APIs enable communication and data exchange between different software systems. In the context of a resume creator website, APIs can be utilized for various purposes, such as integrating with third-party services, accessing external data sources, or enabling collaboration features. Examples include integrating with a cloud storage service for file uploads or using an authentication API for user login.
Database Interface:
The database interface facilitates the interaction between the website and the database where user data, resumes, templates, and other relevant information are stored. It allows the website to retrieve, update, and store data in a structured manner. Common database interfaces include SQL (Structured Query Language) or an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
File Storage Interface:
If the website allows users to upload and store files such as resume attachments, a file storage interface is necessary to handle the storage and retrieval of these files. It may involve integration with a cloud storage service or direct file system access.
Communications Interfaces
Communication interfaces in a resume creator website refer to the methods and protocols used for communication between the website and external entities, such as users, third-party services, or other systems. Here are some common communication interfaces found in a resume creator website:
HTTP/HTTPS:
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure variant, HTTPS, is the primary communication protocol used for web applications. It enables communication between the website's server and clients (web browsers) by exchanging requests and responses. HTTP/HTTPS is used for various interactions, such as retrieving web pages, submitting form data, or requesting resources.
RESTful APIs:
Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs provide a standardized way to interact with web services and exchange data. A resume creator website may expose RESTful APIs to allow external systems or developers to integrate with its features, such as retrieving user data, creating and updating resumes, or accessing template libraries
Other Requirements
Requirements for a resume creator website can vary based on the specific goals and scope of the project. However, here are some common requirements to consider when developing a resume creator website:

A glossary is a collection of terms and their definitions, typically used to provide clarity and understanding of specific concepts within a particular domain. In the context of a resume creator website, a glossary can be created to define and explain key terms and features related to resume creation and the website's functionality. It serves as a reference guide for users, providing them with clear explanations of relevant terms and concepts.
Appendix B: Analysis Models
Analysis models are tools used in software engineering and system development to understand, document, and analyze various aspects of a system or software project. These models help stakeholders gain insights into the system's requirements, behavior, structure, and interactions. Here are some commonly used analysis models:
Use Case Model:
Use case models depict the functional requirements of a system by capturing the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and the system itself. They describe the system's behavior in response to different user actions or events.
Activity Diagram:
Activity diagrams illustrate the flow of activities or processes within a system. They show the sequence of actions, decision points, concurrency, and the overall workflow of a system or a specific process.
